# Larashort
Larashort is a quick and simple Laravel URL shortener. This was made as part of a tutorial which I'll be putting on my blog in due course! I know it's not perfect but it's to give a good all round view of the laravel authentication and simple interactions between Models, Views and Controllers.
This is built on Laravel 5.8.

## Installation
Simply clone down the project and run 'composer install' from the directory!

## Bugs and Issues
Any bugs or issues can be logged through GitHubs issue tracker and I'll respond to them as I can.
